	- The System is Client Server, so the entire game state is stored in the Server.
	- The GameHandler allows us to hide the imlementation details to the Client by 
		only taking in Actions and returning Results.  
	- A lot of the work, however, is done through the Fleet Commander. 

New Game
*********
	- GameHandler controls the majority of the creation. 
	- We use GameHandle as the 'head' of the state of the project. 
	- GameHandler gets from the Client two playerId's that it uses to reference the different players. 
	- The individual players create their ships and stores them internally.
	- The ships create their individual weapons and store Arsenals internally.  
	- The GameHandler then creates and stores a Gameboard (Which initializes itself with bases and 'asteroids'). 
	- This operation requires only the playerId's which will determined from the Client and Networking Interface. 
	- They can be encoded as Strings or Ints and easily passed from the client. 	

Place Ship 
**********
	- The client typically interfaces with the Server by asking it to, "do some action," 
		where the actions are enumeration types.
	- In Place Ship, the client must encode and pass the Enumeration(Place Ship), the ship Id number to be
		placed, the player who wishes to place the ship, and the coordinate to place it at. 	
	- This information can easily be encoded and passed as a String, and decoded in the network interface. 
	- *please note * the Network Interface is not shown in this document for it does not play a role in 
		state changes in the project. Merely an interface between Client and Service. 
	- The Fleet Commanders act as the main controller. 
	- The Fleet Commanders can then easily query their base tiles to determine appropriate spacing and tell the GameBoard
		where the ships are placed. 
	- Fleet commanders must have intimate knowledge of where their ships are placed and what direction they are placed in. 
	- As such, they should control the placement and validation of ships. 

Move Ship
*********
	- Again, the Client queries the Server to do a 'Move' action. It passes the typical information : ShipiD, playerid, x , y, etc.
	- This information can easily be encoded as a String. 
	- The GameHandler tells the Flight Commander to handle and control the move. 
	- As discussed above, the Flight Commander must have intimate knowledge of where the ships are and what are valid moves, 
		as such they control the ships movements.
	- However, they must talk closely with the GameBoard to make sure the moves are valid, so they query the GameBoard to
		get valid moves and distances.
